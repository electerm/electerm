## Dev

```bash
# tested in ubuntu16.04+/mac os 10.13+ only
# needs nodejs/npm, suggest using nvm to install nodejs/npm
# https://github.com/creationix/nvm
# with node 8.6+

git clone git@github.com:electerm/electerm.git
cd electerm
npm i

# start webpack dev server, requires port 5570
npm start

# in a separate terminal session run app
npm run app

# code format check
npm run lint

# code format fix
npm run fix
```

If you encounter some errors when running ```npm run app``` like ```libatk1.0.so.0: cannot open shared object file``` or ```libgtk-3.so.0: cannot open shared object file``` you need to install some required libraries (example for Ubuntu in WSL 2) :

```
sudo apt install libatk1.0-0 libatk1.0-dev libatk-bridge2.0-0 libatk-bridge2.0-dev libgtk-3-0 libgtk-3-dev
```

npm run test
```
