# Electerm Community Code of Conduct

1. **Be Respectful**: Treat everyone with kindness. No harassment or discrimination.
2. **Collaborate Constructively**: Critique ideas, not people.
3. **Support Others**: Help newcomers and value diverse perspectives.
4. **Report Responsibly**: Flag issues via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/electerm/electerm/issues) or contact maintainers privately.

We foster an open, welcoming environment for all contributors.
